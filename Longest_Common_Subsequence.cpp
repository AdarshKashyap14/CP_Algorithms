/*
What is LCS
Longest Common Subsequence is an algorithm that helps us find a subsequence which is common in two different sequences and is longest among all the common subsequences.
It can be understood more clearly with the following example-
sequence1 = ADCB
sequence2 = DAC

subsequences of sequence1 : {A, D, C, B, AD, AC, AB, DC, DB, CB, ADC, ADB, ACB, DCB, ADCB}
subsequences of sequence2 : {D, A, C, DA, DC, AC, DAC}

common subsequences are : {A, D, C, AC, DC}

longest common subsequence : {AC, DC}
