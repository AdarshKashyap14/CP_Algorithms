## Notes
1) **Subarray and Subsequence**\
   A **subarray** is a contiguous part of array. An array that is inside another array.
   For example, consider the array [1, 2, 3, 4], there are 10 non-empty sub-arrays. The subarrays are (1), (2), (3), (4), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (1,2,3), (2,3,4) and (1,2,3,4). 

   A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by removing zero or more elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements. 
   For example, consider the array [1, 2, 3, 4], there are 15 sub-sequences. The subsequences are (1), (2), (3), (4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (1,2,3), (1,2,4), (1,3,4), (2,3,4) and (1,2,3,4).
